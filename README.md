## Getting Started

### Node.js Installation

To check if you already have Node.js installed on your computer, enter node -v in the command line. If successful, the command prompt will return a version number. Otherwise, please install Node.js at https://nodejs.org/en/ and clicking on the LTS version. If you are on Windows, make sure to look for the section that says `Download for Windows (x64)`. If you are using macOS, make sure to look for the section that says `Download for MacOS (x64)`

### Clone the Repo

Once Node.js has been successfully installed, click on the green "<> Code" button and copy the link of the repo. Head over to your code editor and open the terminal. In the terminal, "cd" into the directory you want this repo to be cloned into. Once in the folder, type "git clone" and paste the link copied. The complete repo will be successfully cloned into your folder when entered.

### Express.js

You must also install the Express.js npm package to run the server. Since Express.js is an npm package instead of being built directly into node.js, you must type `npm init` into the command line to allow npm packages to be installed. Next, go to the server.js file, and in the command line, type `npm install express` to install Express.js on your computer. For documentation on Express.js follow this link https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html.
